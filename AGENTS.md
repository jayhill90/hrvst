# HRVST Interactive Website Project Plan

**Project Overview**: Interactive parallax website for electronic music artist HRVST featuring procedurally generated art and shader-based transitions using Three.js.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Animation**: Streams from left/right edges toward center
- **Background**: Particles render behind embedded player
- **Player**: SoundCloud or YouTube playlist embed
- **Effect**: Continuous particle flow animation

### Section 5: Artist Bio Point Network
**Visual**: Floating points connected by dynamic lines
- **Geometry**: Points for nodes, Line segments for connections
- **Animation**: Points float with subtle movement
- **Connections**: Dynamic line drawing between nearby points
- **Content**: Artist biography text and press kit download link
- **Layout**: Text overlaid on point network background

## 🔄 Scroll & Transition System

### Scroll Detection
```javascript
window.addEventListener('scroll', (e) => {
  const scrollPercent = window.scrollY / document.body.scrollHeight;
  updateShaderMorphing(scrollPercent);
  updateCameraPosition(scrollPercent);
  updateTextScaling(scrollPercent);
});
```

### Shader Morphing Logic
- Section boundaries at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% scroll positions
- Interpolation between shader states using uniforms
- Glitch effects during transitions via postprocessing
- Vertex shader morphing between grid → sphere → cubes → particles → points

### Performance Considerations
- Single renderer instance across all sections
- Geometry instancing where possible
- Shader uniform updates over geometry recreation
- Lazy loading of textures and audio content

## 🎛 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Setup ✅ (Todo #2)
- Project structure initialization
- Three.js and postprocessing dependencies
- Basic HTML/CSS framework
- Scroll detection system

## 🌀 Branching & Pull Request Workflow

To ensure a robust and maintainable codebase, each major phase of development is implemented in a dedicated feature branch. The workflow for each phase is as follows:

1. **Create a new branch** for the phase (e.g., `feature/phase-2-shader-morphing`).
2. **Develop and commit** all changes for that phase in the feature branch.
3. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** from the feature branch into `master`.
4. **PR Description** includes a summary of the phase, a checklist of completed tasks, and a random robot dance gif from [Giphy](https://giphy.com/search/robot-dance).
5. **Review and merge** the PR into `master` after validation.
6. **Repeat** for each subsequent phase.

This approach allows for easy reversion, code review, and clear separation of features. If a phase introduces issues, it can be reverted or fixed independently without affecting the rest of the project.
