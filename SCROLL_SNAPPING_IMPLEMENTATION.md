# Scroll Snapping Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented smooth scroll snapping that centers each section's content in the viewport height, providing a more controlled and professional navigation experience for the HRVST website.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. CSS Scroll Snapping
- **`scroll-snap-type: y mandatory`** on body element for mandatory vertical snapping
- **`scroll-snap-align: start`** on each section to create snap points
- **`scroll-snap-stop: always`** to ensure each section is visited during scrolling
- **`scroll-behavior: smooth`** for smooth transitions between sections

### 2. Section-Based Navigation
**Viewport-Based Sections:**
- Each section is exactly 100vh (viewport height)
- Content automatically centered in viewport
- Sections: Home (0vh), Release (100vh), Gallery (200vh), Mixes (300vh), Bio (400vh)

**Updated ScrollController Logic:**
- Simplified section detection based on viewport multiples
- More accurate section progress calculation
- Improved camera positioning for scroll snapping

### 3. Multiple Navigation Methods

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- ↓ Arrow Down / Page Down: Next section
- ↑ Arrow Up / Page Up: Previous section  
- Home: First section
- End: Last section

**Mouse/Scroll Wheel:**
- Natural scrolling with automatic snap-to-section after scroll stops
- 150ms timeout for smooth snap behavior
- Configurable snap threshold (15% of section height)

**Visual Navigation Dots:**
- Fixed position dots on right side showing current section
- Click to jump directly to any section
- Active state with glow effect
- Hover effects for better UX

### 4. Enhanced User Experience

**Navigation Hints:**
- Subtle instruction text at bottom of screen
- Auto-hide after first scroll interaction
- Non-intrusive guidance for new users

**Smooth Transitions:**
- CSS and JavaScript work together for buttery-smooth movement
- Adaptive scroll speed (faster when far, slower when close)
- Eased section transitions with advanced animation curves

**Visual Feedback:**
- Active dot highlighting current section
- Smooth opacity transitions for navigation elements
- Consistent white glow aesthetic matching site theme

### 5. Technical Implementation

**ScrollController Enhancements:**
```javascript
// Viewport-based section detection
getCurrentSection() {
    const viewportHeight = window.innerHeight;
    const scrollTop = window.scrollY;
    return Math.floor(scrollTop / viewportHeight);
}

// Smart snapping after scroll wheel
snapToNearestSection(threshold = 0.15) {
    // Auto-snap if close to section boundary
}
```

**CSS Scroll Snap Properties:**
```css
body {
    scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
}

.section {
    height: 100vh;
    scroll-snap-align: start;
    scroll-snap-stop: always;
}
```

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Precise Navigation**: Content always perfectly centered in viewport
- **No Awkward Scrolling**: Can't stop between sections
- **Multiple Control Methods**: Keyboard, mouse, or visual navigation
- **Intuitive**: Natural scrolling behavior with smart snapping

### Developer Experience  
- **Simplified Logic**: Section detection based on simple viewport calculations
- **Consistent Layout**: Each section guaranteed to be full-height
- **Easy Maintenance**: Clear section boundaries and predictable behavior

### Performance
- **Browser-Native**: Uses CSS scroll-snap for optimal performance
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Enhanced by JS but doesn't depend on it
- **Smooth Animation**: Hardware-accelerated CSS transitions

## Configuration Options

All scroll snapping behavior can be fine-tuned in `TransitionConfig.js`:

```javascript
sections: {
    snapThreshold: 0.15,        // Auto-snap sensitivity
    transitionZone: 0.1,        // Fade transition distance
}
```

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with CSS Scroll Snap support (95%+ coverage)
- Graceful degradation to normal scrolling in older browsers
- Touch device optimized for mobile experience

## Result
The website now provides a polished, app-like scrolling experience where each section is perfectly framed in the viewport, making the content presentation much more impactful and professional.
